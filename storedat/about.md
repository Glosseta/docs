# What is Storedat.io?
Storedat.io is a GraphQL API made to improve the developer experience when using decentralized storage. We remove the burden of signing transactions, paying for uploads, holding private key, etc... All you need to get up and running is an api-key so that you can concentrate on what matters most: reading and writing data

# Why do we exist
Concretely, we exist to accelerate the adoption of decentralized storage by providing a provider agnostic way to read and write data with those protocols all the while abstracting web3 away from the user. While we might start with Filecoin and Arweave today, our vision is to expand out and support more storage providers in the future. The ultimate goal is to have Storedat become the goto hub for anyone to plug and play with decentralized storage.

# Our mission
Storedat is on a mission to provide a better user experience for both web2 and web3 users wanting to take advantage of decentralized storage. We want to make decentralized storage accessible to all so that anyone can use it without having to deal with its complexities. No dealing with wallets, signing transactions, managing private keys, paying transaction costs, and so on. Just plug in and Storedat
